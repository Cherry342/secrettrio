    <p class="h4">Hurricane Names Retired and Replaced</p>
    <div class="text-sandytan bg-orange"> <p>In the past, all hurricane names were all girls. But after Carol and Hazel were retired, the NOAA decided to make a list of new names without the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z.
        All four lists were repeated for 4 years until 1972. The new lists decided to have both male and female names. The WMO started that new lists of names since 1972. Each list was repeated
        every 6 years. In 2020, when Hurricane Laura was retired and replaced with Leah for 2026, the WMO decided to retired the list of all the greek alphabet including Eta and 
        Iota. They replaced with a list of auxarily list of names that look like an American Kindergarten class. The Eastern Pacific did the same ways too like the Alantic.
   But, the latest retired name was Patricia of 2015. The Eastern Pacific did the same replaced list of auxraily names after the Greek Alphabet which was withdrawn. 
If a hurricane is too strong or causes dameges, the name is reitred and replaced with an another one. Also, I used that idea for making my characters on Gacha Club. 
 (There were too many names retired with the letter I ).</p>
