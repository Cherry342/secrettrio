 <p class="h2">Fluent Languages that I speak</p>
  <p> I speak languages mostly of the time. I speak Japanese with my mom most of the time.  I been learning Chinese every Tuesday. Right now, in my high school, Mandarin Chinese and Spanish are the only foreign languages that you can learn.
I was the only junior in the Mandarin Chinese class in period 8. Chinese is also part of my schedule in my high school. Everyone was surpised when I speak fluently. I learned in Spanish in Middle School. My middle school is the Dock Street School
for STEAM Studies. It's close to my Elementary School: P.S 307.
