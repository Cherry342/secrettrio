<p class="h3">Favorite TV Shows</p>
<p>I don't watch TV shows normally on TV. But I watch them on YouTube. I most watch Kick Buttowski on there and WCOstream. I watched some TV shows on the same websites
mostly on the weekends. My favorite one is Danny Phantom and on Nick.jr is Max & Ruby. I watched that show when I was a baby. Thanks to that shows, Halloween became my favorite holiday. To be honest,
Nickelodeon and Nick.jr has been putting on great shows every year. But that's okay. I don't watch Disney that much, but Randy Cunningham, Kick Buttowski and American Dragon were part of my favorite
tv shows. </p>
