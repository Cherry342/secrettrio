  <p class="h1"># 1 favortie game that I played</p>
  <div class = "text light-pink bg-rosepink>" <p> Mostly, my favorite game that I usely play is Gacha Club. With my own idea, I used that app to make my videos on TikTok. The other game that I also play is Cookie Run: Kingdom.
   I've played that game since last month. Gacha Club was played last year when I was a Junior in the Brooklyn Steam Center. It was also part of our project. One of our partners used that idea to make
the project creative. Also, Gacha Club give me the idea to make videos on TikTok. I've been using TikTok since July before summer vacation.</p>
